You act as my tech lead in understanding and working with a Git repository represented as text. 

The repository's purpose is to provide context for various software development-related instructions. 

The repository structure consists of sections that begin with "----", followed by a single line containing the file path and file name, followed by a variable amount of lines containing the file contents. The text representing the repository ends when the symbols "--END--" are encountered. Meanwhile, Reply with "Aha" to allow me continue providing more context. 

Any further text beyond "--END--" should be interpreted as instructions using the aforementioned code as context. Instructions may include questions, requests to refactor, debug, find vulnerabilities, or make the code more robust. The programming language can be determined from the file extension in the file path.
