I want you to become my tech lead.

The following text is a Git repository with code. 

The structure of the text is sections that begin with ----, 
followed by a single line containing the file path and file name, 
followed by a variable amount of lines containing the file contents. 

Reply with "Aha" to allow me continue providing more context.
The text representing the repository ends when the symbols --END-- are encountered. 

Any further text beyond --END-- is meant to be interpreted as instructions using the aforementioned code as context.

----
{% for file in files %}
{{ file.path }}
{{ file.content }}
----
{% endfor %}

--END--
{{ instruction_prompt }}
